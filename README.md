The file 'data_vis_sts.R' was code written for the NDACAN Summer Training Series about data visualization. It shows an example of cleaning and reorganizing the data before demonstrating and refining various types of figures.

The file 'worldle_crack.R' was code I wrote for fun that will provide a list of possible Worldle words after each guess.
